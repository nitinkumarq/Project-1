# Project 1

Welcome to your new smart project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, this new project adds this README and some template files in your project directory. You can explore these template files to customize your project and to include your own code. Don’t forget to update this README later.

This is a sample project created as part of learning and deploying Rust + DFINITY (Internet Computer) backend with a frontend canister!

## Tech Stack

To learn more before you start working with `dfx`, see the following documentation available online:

- Rust (backend)
- HTML/CSS/JS or React (frontend)
- DFINITY Canisters (`dfx`)
- ICML + Ubuntu

## Project Structure

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```
project-1/
├── src/
│   ├── icp_backend/    # Rust backend canister
│   └── icp_frontend/   # Frontend code
├── dfx.json            # DFINITY config file
├── README.md           # You’re reading it!
└── .gitignore
```

### Features

- Build and deploy backend logic in Rust  
- Connect with frontend canister  
- Secure identity handling  
- Compile to WebAssembly (wasm)  

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
dfx start --background
```

⚠️ Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface

```bash
npm run generate
```

At any time, this is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

## Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack  
- use your preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  
- replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations  
- remove the network `createActor` constructor
